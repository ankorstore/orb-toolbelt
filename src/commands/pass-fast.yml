description: >
  This command will pass a job (or individual node of a parallel job) fast on retries when it has previously succeeded in this pipeline.

  This preserves previous artifacts and optionally resubmits test results so that the resulting job report and artifacts are consistent.

  This command should be the first step in your job and all other steps should be provided as the `steps` parameter.

  This command requires jq to be installed (it is already on all circleci cimg/* images).

  This command requires a CIRCLE_TOKEN env var to be set with a valid CircleCi API Token.
parameters:
  pipeline-id:
    type: string
