  This command waits for a job(s) in this workflow to finish before continuing.

  Since right now CircleCI doesn't let you queue up jobs irrespective of whether previous jobs fail or not,
  this command should be run in a sibling job ( no `requires` for the jobs it is waiting for) and will wait
  for the other job(s) to complete before it continues its work.

  This command requires a CIRCLE_TOKEN env var to be set with a valid CircleCi API Token.
