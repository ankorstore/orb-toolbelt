  Store artifacts as a gzip compressed tarball

  This can be a performance improvement when storing a large number of files or very large but highly compressible files such as logs.
parameters:
  tarball_name:
    type: string
    description: Name for the compressed tarball, must be unique within this job
  path:
    type: string
    description: Path to file or directory to store
  destination:
    type: string
    description: Destination directory to store the tarball, defaults to the path but should be provided if the path is a file.
    default: ""
steps:
  - run:
      name: Compressing << parameters.tarball_name >>
      environment:
        TARBALL_NAME: << parameters.tarball_name >>
        ARTIFACT_PATH: << parameters.path >>
