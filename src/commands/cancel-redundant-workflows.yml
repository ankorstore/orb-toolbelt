  Cancels any previous running or on-hold workflows for the same branch.

  CircleCI can do this automatically when this feature is enabled in project settings for all branches EXCEPT the default branch.
  There is however no way to filter what branches are affected or to include the default branch.
  This command can be used with an appropriate `when` step to do this.

  This command requires a CIRCLE_TOKEN env var to be set with a valid CircleCi API Token.
parameters:
  workflow-name:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The name of teh workflow you wish to cancel.
      Will default to the current workflow name.
      You can use regex if you start your name with ^.
      Using regex you can target multiple workflow names this can be helpful if you are using setup workflows and wish to cancel any pipelines still setting up as well as if they have started the continuation workflows(s).
steps:
  - run:
      name: Cancelling redundant workflows
      environment:
        TARGET_WORKFLOW_NAME: << parameters.workflow-name >>
      command: << include(scripts/cancel-redundant-workflows.sh) >>
